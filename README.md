# Virtual Pet Shelter

I started with testing, wrote all the tests out.
Wrote out the necessary methods to pass the tests then.

Referenced the bank teller project for many of the tests and methods and how they would work.

I then began to write the VirtualPetShelter app. There were a couple of methods that I found I needed for certain things, like printing the pets and their status.
I wrote those methods and tested them within the app to make sure they worked as intended. I then wrote the rest of the app.
I tested the app many times to make sure everything worked as it should and there were no issues with anything.
I then added the cleanliness and option to clean a cage after making sure everything else worked.
